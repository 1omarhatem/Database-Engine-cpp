# 🔧 Simple Database Engine (In C++) – Preparation Phase

🚧 **Project Status: In Preparation**  
This project aims to explore and implement the core internals of a **relational database engine** using C++.  
It's a learning-driven initiative focusing on low-level system design and database internals.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a minimal **SQL-like database engine** from scratch
- Understand how storage engines manage data on disk
- Learn how query parsing and execution work
- Implement indexing (B-trees, hashing) and basic optimization techniques
- Practice clean, modular C++ systems programming

---

## 📦 Key Components (Planned)

- Parser & SQL Interpreter
- Storage Engine (File I/O, Page Manager)
- Record Management
- Indexing Mechanisms
- Transaction & Concurrency (if possible in later stages)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: **C++**
- Tools: CMake, Git, Unit Testing (Catch2 or GoogleTest)

---

## 🤝 Want to Collaborate?

I'm currently in the **early planning & research phase**.  
If you're interested in:
- Learning how database engines work  
- Building low-level systems  
- Contributing to open source

Then feel free to **open an issue**, **start a discussion**, or **drop me a message**.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a **learning project**, not intended for production use.  
The goal is to document and understand, not to compete with mature DBMSs.

## 📅 Timeline

- 🧠 Research & Planning: (in progress)
- 📄 Design Docs & Specs: (soon)
- 💻 Code Implementation: (TBD)
